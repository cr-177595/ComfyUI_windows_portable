# CLIPAdd

The CLIPAdd node combines two CLIP models by merging their key patches. It creates a copy of the first CLIP model and then adds most of the key patches from the second model, excluding position IDs and logit scale parameters. This allows you to blend features from different CLIP models while preserving the structure of the first model.
